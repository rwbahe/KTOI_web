                    <p>
                        in 1989, the Kootenai Tribe, with funding from the Bonneville Power Administration, initiated a
                        conservation aquaculture program to prevent the extinction of Kootenai River white sturgeon. The
                        Kootenai strugeon, a unique stock that has been seperated from other Columbia river white
                        sutrgeon stocks since the last glacial ice age, was listed as endangered in 1994 under the
                        Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Tribe, in coordination with state and federal agencies, has
                        been intergrally involved in the recovery effort as a co-manager of the Kootenai River System.
                        The Tribe's work to conserve natural resources does not end with Kootenai sturgeon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Tribe recognizes the connection of all resources within the Web of Life and acknowledges
                        that preservation of the Tribe and the complex ecosystems upon whichwe all depend relies on
                        protecting resources in a holistic manner. Other Tribal projects include actions to identify
                        factors that are limiting native resident fish and wildlife, and projects to address those
                        factors through ecosystem-based restoration actions. Because the entire ecosystem has been
                        altered for decades, much has been lost; however, the Tribe looks to the future with the hope
                        that self-sustaining populations of native fish and wildlife may once again inhabit the Kootenai
                        watershed in abundance.

                            The Kootenai Tribe's aquaculture program began in 1989 as a small experimental hatchery for
                            Kootenai River white sturgeon. The program has since evolved to include many aspects of
                            native fish restoration and aquaculture. The primary purpose of the aquaculture program is
                            to prevent exctintion of Kootenai sturgeon and reestablish a native burbot population.
                            Upgrades to the existing Tribal Hatchery and construction of a new Twin Rivers Hatchery were
                            completed in 2014.

                            The Ecosystem Improvement Project includes nutrient restoration and extensive biomonitoring.
                            This project addresses nutrient losses associated with elimination of large annual flushing
                            flows and losses of floodplain and side channel connectivity. The goal of the project is to
                            recover a productive, healthy and biologically diverse Kootenai River ecosystem with an
                            emphasis on native fish. The Tribe implements the river nutrient addition in collaboration
                            with Idaho Department of Fish and Game.

                            The Kootenai River Habitat Restoration Program is a large scale, ecosystem-based habitat
                            restoration program designed to restore and maintain Kootenai River habitat conditions that
                            support all life stages of endangered Kootenai River white sturgeon, burbot, and other
                            native fish within a 55-mile reach of the Kootenai River in Idaho. Activities include
                            planning, data collection and analysis, design, and phased implementation of multiple
                            habitat restoration projects.
